\section*{Data Description}
All the data were fetched from UCI repository \parencite{Dua:2017}
\begin{description}
	\item[Abalone data] The data consists of 7 features of abalone physical measurements like sex, length, shell weight, etc,. The task is to classify abalone by their ages. We only picked the age data in $[5, 15]$ which has more than 100 records per each class and constructed a binary classifier on the ages ranges from $[5,9]$ and $[10, 15]$. The final data contains 3842 instances---1820 negative, 2022 positive.
	
	\item[Digit data] The data contains 1797 instances of $8 \times 8$ images hand-written digits, 64 features. We constructed a binary classifier between odd and even digits -- 891 negative, 906 positive.
		
	\item[20Newsgroup data, 20news-bydate version] This is a collection of nearly 20,000 newsgroup documents, divided into 20 different groups. In total, the origin set consists of 18774 instances with a vocabulary size of 61188 words. In our experiment, we only set binary classifiers for the major groups. So we constructed 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item comp versus rec groups, 8870 instances---4891 negative, 3979 positive
		\item comp versus sci groups, 8843 instances---4891 negative, 3952 positive
		\item comp versus talk groups, 8144 instances---4891 negative, 3253 positive
	\end{itemize}

\section*{Experiments Reproduction and Complete Results}
The experiment was conducted on Python 3.6 programming language \parencite{python3.6}, libraries Numpy \parencite{numpy}, Scikit-Learn \parencite{scikit-learn} and Igraph \parencite{Csardi2006}. All of the resources are uploaded online at \url{https://github.com/nghiapickup/master_thesis} with detailed descriptions. We can reconstruct the experiments or get the complete results there.
